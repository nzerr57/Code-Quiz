# Code-Quiz

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a multiple-choice quiz about coding facts. The quiz begins once the start button is pressed and the timer will begin counting down. When the user selects an answer it will let them know whether it was right or wrong and continue onto the next question. Once the quiz is completed, the user is prompted to input their initials. Their score is then stored on a high scores page.
